# Learn-english-site
This is a simple website to learn English. Written in html, css, scss and javascript. On the home page there are flashcards that, when clicked, translate a word from Polish to English or from English to Polish. On the Lessons.html website there are also flashcards in which you can reveal words and mark whether you know a given word (unfortunately, after refreshing the page, this data is lost - in the future, the website will be connected to the database, which will fix this problem). Then on we have two ways to check your knowledge - multiple choice test and guess the word. Guess the word takes the word provided by the user, converts it to lowercase letters and compares it with its translation, and then adds a point depending on the correctness. At the end, a message is displayed with the number of points and the color >= 80% green, >= 50% yellow, < 50 red is selected based on the number of points. The choice test works the same, but the correct word is extracted from the clicked field on the form. Slownik.html is a simple website without JavaScript containing only text: words and their translations.
